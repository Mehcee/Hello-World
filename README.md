# Hello-World

This is supposed to be a guide on how GitHub works, but I'm still confused.
Hopefully, I'll get the hang of it soon enough.





<h1> Hello World </h1>
<p> 
I think I understand a little now, just a tiny bit though. So I think I'll just ask my developer friends  who have been in the game for a long time.<br>
For now, I'll just continuue my CSS lessons.
